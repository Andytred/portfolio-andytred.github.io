                <h3>THE CHALLENGE</h3>
                <h4 class="program">I was asked to analyze Lucie Glaister;s website and make suggestions on how to improve the overall usability. Though the client had found success with e-commerce, she felt there was a lot of room for improvement. Specifically, she wanted users to spend more time on her website and make it easier for them to browse and look around as they would if they were in a physical location</h4>
                 <h4 class="program">The end result was a UX/UI redesign and adding a user profile feature. The user profile feature benefits users, many of which are repeat customers, by allowing them to select favorite products, share pages and products via social networks, and generally reduce the UX friction for her most valuable and loyal customers. The feature also benefits the company by allowing them to establish a customer relationship management (CRM) program via the collection of emails which can be leveraged with a newsletter, special offers, etc.. </h4>
                <h3>METHOD</h3>
                <H4 style="font-weight: bold">Usability testing</H4>
                <h4>Of course, I started with a much larger list of assumptions and possible improvements, but to ensure I was only spending time designing the most impactful, I tested these assumptions with usability tests with 3 people who matched the target market. (Slightly older 30-45 years old with a passion for high quality food)</h4>
                <H4 style="font-weight: bold">I identified these two specific use cases to focus the work: </H4>
                <h4>Purchase - Efficiently browse the retailers selection of premium, wine, chocolate and delicacies to find the perfect item for your tastes and/or needs </h4>
                <h4>Subscribe to newsletter - People with passion for premium food, looking for not only handmade high quality food, but they also want to buy products which are made from seasonal food. </h4>

            <h3><strong>Low-Fidelity and Mid-Fidelity Wireframes<strong></h3>
            <h4 style="font-weight: normal">First I sketched out a few ideas on paper, I selected and used what made the most sense and to get a good overview of the product I created Low-fidelity Wireframes. I designed a mobile first responsive web app and for that I choose 8 column grids. To create not  only Wireframes, but also <strong>Style Guide</strong> and prototypes I used <strong>Figma</strong></h3>

            </div>
            <h3><strong>Style guide</strong></h3>
            <h4 style="font-weight: normal">I created a style guide to be more consistent and efficient while working with Figma. Also during creating a style guide I felt the importance to keep it clear and organized not only for other UX designers, but also for developers</h3>

            <h3><strong>Wireframes</strong></h3>
            <h4 style="font-weight: normal">I created a wireframe where you can see the user flow from the home page, adding products to a wishlist, sharing wishlist, buying a product, with a simple card to thank customers for buying the product</h4>

        <h4 class="create" style="font-weight: normal">In the image can be seen the whole process from the sketch to the final version.In the first version of wireframes I created a navigation menu, which was not very practical at this project. Also in the earlier iteration the color scheme was too light and the design did not follow the color of brand name. I was learning along the way and decided for a warmer color</h4>

        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 60px">In the category section I created microinteraction - horizontal scrollbar, to keep the website more engaging, which positively contributing to the look-and-feel of a product</h5>

        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 60px">Stars on the original website could be confusing, because it is not possible to rating the product. Instead I added reviews. In case user don’t find suitable product, can look into a similar products which is placed on the bottom of the page</h5>

        <h3>REFLECTIONS</h3>
        <h4 style="font-weight: normal">This project helped me develop UX design skills and how to bring that together with my ‘offline’ service design skills and experience. Additionally, I saw myriad small, yet meaningful improvements in my ability to execute each of the various phases from research, observing user behavior, personas, prototyping, to the ultimate final design. In particular with how to efficiently and effectively iterate those processes to meet particularly high expectations of this client and her customers</h4>

                <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
                <h4 class="program">The goal was to i) establish a program for identifying high performing employees with leadership potential within a company and ii) identify how to best train them for leadership positions. Specifically, my thesis concentrated on how a firm can gain a competitive advantage by identifying and supporting potential leaders within a company more effectively than their competitors with a high potential employee program. Though the thesis was done in partnership with the head of HR at Rovio, a global video game and consumer products company, the fundamentals, foundation, and service design processes behind this program are applicable virtually in any company</h4>
                <h3>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h3>
                <h4>Identifying and training high potential employees or recruiting them is expensive and time consuming. As a result, the goal of this program is to give firms the best return on the investment possible by identifying the most effective leadership identification and training practices</h4>

        <h3><strong>Discover<strong></h3>
        <h4 style="font-weight: normal">The main goal of this part was to discover primary challenges companies commonly face. I created a <strong>questionaire</strong> for an employees from 5 international companies. I also <strong>interviewed</strong> HR people and managers from 3 international companies with over 100 employees. The goal was to find out the best practices of their program and tools they are using.  </h3>
        <h4 style="font-weight: normal">Based on the research I created two <strong>personas</strong> which representing different type of leaders. It provided me different perspective on how the program should be created depending on the needs of the company and personality of their leaders.  </h4>

        </div>
            
        <h3><strong>Define</strong></h3>
        <h4 style="font-weight: normal">In the discovery phase a great deal of information was gained. The next step was to narrow the large amount of information collected in the research down to the most impactful and actionable ideas. The <strong>blueprint</strong> methodology was employed to accomplish this. </h3>

        <h3><strong>Develope</strong></h3>
        <h4 style="font-weight: normal">In this phase I started creating program itself.</h4>

        </div>

        <h3><strong>Deliver</strong></h4>
        <h4 style="font-weight: normal">For a prototyping part I used an <strong>Expert review</strong> when main goal was to detect how suitable the program is for companies. For Expert review I brought together three professionals - experienced HR person, one leadership emotional intelingece specialist and one experienced leader. Based on the feedback I iterate the program and created final version.</h3>

        <h3>REFLECTIONS</h3>
        <h4 style="font-weight: normal" class="create">To create such as program I used the best practices from the research. The most helpful was interviews with different companies and their employees. I also found very powerful Personas for a better understaning of users and Blueprint which gave me a detailed information of every step in the program.</h4>

      <h3>TESTIMONIAL</h3>
      <h4 style="font-weight: normal">“In general, I have to say that you have done an excellent work. I see this kind of program working in a bigger company where there is more employees so you can actually have different development paths and talent maps for senior and junior leaders.”</h4>

                <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
                <h4 class="program">The goal was to establish a program of how to identify high performing employees with leadership potential within a company and how to best train them for manager and executive positions. For my thesis, I concentrated on how a firm can gain a competitive advantage by identifying and supporting potential leaders within a company more effectively with a high potential employee program. The fundamentals, foundation, and service design processes behind this program should be usable in virtually in any company.</h4>
                <h3>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h3>
                <h4> Identifying and training high potential employees is expensive and time consuming. As a result, the goal of this program is to give firms the best return on the investment possible by identifying the most effective leadership identification and training practices.

            <h3><strong>Discover<strong></h3>
            <h4>The main goal of this part was to discover primary challenges companies commonly face. I created a <strong>questionaire</strong> for an employees from 5 international companies. I also <strong>interviewed</strong> HR people and managers from 3 international companies with over 100 employees. The goal was to find out the best practices of their program and tools they are using.  </h3>
            <h4>Based on the research I created two <strong>personas</strong> which representing different type of leaders. It provided me different perspective on how the program should be created depending on the needs of the company and personality of their leaders.  </h4>

For Expert review I brought together three professionals - experienced HR person, one leadership emotional intelingece specialist and one experienced leader. Based on the feedback I iterate the program and created final version.</h3>
